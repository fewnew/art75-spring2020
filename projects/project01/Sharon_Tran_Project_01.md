Perception Through Nature

Experimental Video

The video starts out with a monochrome setting where it represents anxiety and stress from school/work and etc. As the door opens, it shows the colors of the outside world. 
The idea behind it is portraying an abstract representation of the self-reflection to inner self-care such as taking walks, looking a nature or daydreaming. In my artistic approach, I was going for a lighthearted and cinematic style by incorporating the nature of the school campus and blending in flowers to represent the illusion.
