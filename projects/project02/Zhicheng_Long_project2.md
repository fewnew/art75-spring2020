  The meaning of home is that the most important thing is to be with my family, be able to gather together, and put yourself in a comfortable place, and the second is to be able to sleep. This is what I think of home, warm, comfortable, happy, and free gathering place. In the aero video, I put a family of three people in three groups, the first one is watching TV together, the second is dancing, and the third is sleeping. These are things that I think can be presented in a family, but the main thing is a homemade up of many people.
