5. The look of the piece is contemporary with a mostly muted color pallet. I want to create a piece where the audience can emphasize with the personâ€™s struggle to achieve success. Opening unknown doors is seen as taking a leap of faith. Sometimes it leads to something good, sometimes something bad. The path to success is full of ups and downs and I want to create a piece showing the relationship between opening doors and success. Every person in his/her lifetime feels this urge to take chances with their lives and while the ending is left on a cliffhanger, this desire to take chances in order to pursue success and happiness is never ending.
