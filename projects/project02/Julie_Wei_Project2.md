2. Augumented Reality, Board Game
3. **Duration:** 30 seconds
4. **Description:** The video mainly focuses on my identity of having come from Taiwan to America during my childhood, thus why the airplane flying from Taiwan to San Francisco. The utilization of a game board in the video stems from my siblings' and I's love of the game--hence another form of "Home," in a sense. With the alien-looking jellyfish, the narrative is that of an "alien" residing in San Francisco. The child with the balloon in Taiwan, on the other hand, speaks to my childhood spent in Taiwan.
