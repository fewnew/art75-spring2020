For this project, I want to convey that home is where your family is, blood or not. Family is with you throughout 
your entire life and supports you through everything. Family is also linked to your identity as well as family usually
molds you to who you are. This also links to identity because when you are with your family, you are your truest self. 
Family allows you to be who you are without any judgements. In my Aero video. I have a path of photos of my closest 
friends and family leading up to a house. The photos of the people I consider family are leading me to a house. Since
family help guide you in life and help develop your identity, I decided to have them lead you to the home as well in 
the project.
