For my concept of Identity and Meaning of Home, my AR is a representation of my childhood memories. I was born and raised in San Jose, the feeling of home is warm and comfortable as I’ve lived in the same house. 
Home isn’t just a house or a roof over your head but is a place that surrounds you and what makes you who you are. Growing up, my parents were very strict so I didn’t have many memories besides always being at home. I chose to film outside of my backyard (although I have a fear of my backyard) since I had memories with my family picking persimmons, oranges, and lemons.
