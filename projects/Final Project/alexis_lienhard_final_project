<h3> Revelation Gallery feels deserted, cold, and mysterious. You can feel the thickness in the air because it is deserted of all human life except for you who is walking through our large but empty gallery. Our motivation for this project was a series of what-ifs and alternate futures. So we had two which involved an alternative future after a nuclear-induced apocalypse and artificial intelligence apocalypse. In our gallery you may be curious to look around and see what it is about or you will feel hopeless just wanting to understand why are artwork is the way it is. With how are gallery was created to look and the meaning of Revelation, the divine destruction of the unknowingness of our gallery is a  message or a warning to humankind in the future as well as now. My portion is about AI/artificial intelligence and how in our current world. Science and technology are growing faster and faster every day, while robots are slowly looking more and more human every day. I want to expose the soon to be foreseeable dangers of AI; in the future generations as well as our current generation from being careful with how we handle electronics, with my partners in this gallery. </h3>
