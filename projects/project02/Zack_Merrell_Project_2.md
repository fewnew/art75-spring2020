# Project 2
For my video I wanted to create a little set of models that would represent who I am. I also wanted to add in a physical object in there to show how they react with each other and can combine to get what you want. I add in a soccer ball that has a classic art symbol for Santa Cruz Locals on the front. I then created a 3D model of the house I grew up in and surrounded it with other little models to show a little extra detail into who I am.
