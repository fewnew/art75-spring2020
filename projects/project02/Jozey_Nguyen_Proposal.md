Project 02: AR Written Project Proposal

For this AR project, I am going to be using my past to represent my home, because it has made me who I am today. From today onwards, home is who I will be, because my past guided me to move forward, to improve, and look to the future. And my future is going to be my home forever, but my past is the base of my life and who I am, so that part of my life will be the first home I will ever have in my heart. I will be using my family living room as the background of this video, because that is where my family gathers and where my home starts since I was raised with my family. So where they live is my home, but initially the place I call home is in their hearts. The elements I am going to be using are family photographs, a few pet photographs, and icons that helped me feel at home. The meaning of home to me is that no matter where I am, as long as I am happy, I feel at home.
