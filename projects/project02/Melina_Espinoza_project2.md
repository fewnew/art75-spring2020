To me, home was always one place. I never lived anywhere else but in a small town in Northern California with my big family and pets. Moving to a big city, three hours away from home was a culture shock. After a couple years of living in San Jose, I have two homes now. I wanted to incorporate the home that is always in my heart with the home that I have currently.
