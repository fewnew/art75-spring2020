## Proposal: 
I want to create an interactive 3D piece in Aero and combine it with some physical objects that I have. I want to show who I am as a person through literal 3D models created in Dimension. The physical object that I have is a soccer ball that has a logo that is really close to every Santa Cruz Locals heart. I want to add this because it shows where I grew up and that is a big part of who I am. I will then add other digital models that represent who I am.
