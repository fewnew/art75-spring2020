To me, home was always one place. I never lived anywhere else but in a small town in Northern California with my big family and pets. Moving to a big city, three hours away from home was a culture shock. After a couple years of living in San Jose, I have two homes now. I wanted to incorporate the home that is always in my heart with the home that I have currently. (My little dorm room) Growing up, there was pictures everywhere. In frames on the wall, in organized photobooks, and in a full box under the bed. Pictures, and the memories that come with them, are my home as well. Lastly, I can't leave out my dogs and hamster. I grew up with Rocky and Franky who are politely standing by my desk. And Shaggy, my hamster, who I got a year ago, is runninh aroung on my desk. Without pets and pictures, no matter where I am, my house isn't a home.
