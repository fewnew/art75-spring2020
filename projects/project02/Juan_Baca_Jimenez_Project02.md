## Description
For this project I thought about how I define the term "home". I used Adobe Aero and implementing 2-d and 3-d objects into Aero to make of a more AR experience.
I defined "home" as something we are passionate in doing and love to do, the feeling of confortablity I feel like is a factor of home. I feel like you can bring home within something you enjoy doing.
For me I included soccer related objects and a couple pictures because I am passionate about soccer and I feel like when I play I feel at home because it makes me happy and confortable in what I'm doing.
I added clips in front of my house and added some text in the video saying that Home is not really all just about where you reside, but something you love doing too.
