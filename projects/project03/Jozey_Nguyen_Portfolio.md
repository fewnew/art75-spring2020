5. Description 

  This portfolio was created to showcase many of my artworks that I have created throughout my time in SJSU. It is a website, coded by me with the help of my professors and classmates. The conceptual theme of this website is to illustrate what I love and see, such as the colors and style of the pages. Behind this project is to be used as a portfolio for job applications and for myself to show others what I have learned and experienced through my artworks presented. The audience will experience both dark and light colors in the theme due to my personality and being, because I believe everyone has a dark and light side to them. The influence of this website was from my professor to help me improve my coding and allow a place for me to store and show my work. I appreciate everyone for helping get this far in the arts today.
