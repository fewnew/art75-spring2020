<p>Description:</p>

<p>The concept of my gallery is continuity. Some things tend to change over time while others stay the same. 
Love and pain are some things that, as long as we are still here, will always be present no matter what. 
In the same sense, my work represents the concept of masks and armor. 
Metaphorically speaking, the armor has served since the dawn of time to protect and safeguard one’s integrity. 
Hence, a well crafter armor will be your most dependable ally when going to battle, but a defectuous one will only slow you down. 
Therefore, I present a transition from medieval armor to cyber-futuristic armor to exemplify the same idea – some things never change just improve.</p>
