# Final Project: Virtual Gallery

Virtual Institute of Simulacra Art (VISA) is a collective space for exhibiting artworks online. Each student/group builds their own Mini-Gallery including 2D or 3D artworks such as sculptures, paintings, illustrations, videos, etc.

### Discussion
1. How does every work resonate with each other in this Art 75 class group show? For example, if you team up with 2-4 people to curate a virtual museum together, can you find something in common in your artist practices? How do you connect all the pieces and create a new narrative? 
2. Also, if you decide to have a solo museum, what makes your museum, ideas, concepts distinct from the others?  Or maybe your museum is a response to your peers' idea, the feedback of this class, the reflection of the current world? 
3. As a viewer, what kind of museum you want to explore? 

### In terms of future museums and future art, I would like to think: 
* What's the meaning of "collective?" Why are some artworks recognized as a representative memory? 
* Why do people like to collect artwork? (Physically and mentally collect beauties, inspirations)
* Why do we need institutions to preserve and collect those arts?
* Is there any open-sourced museum?
