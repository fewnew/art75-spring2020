5. Description 
When people work, go to school, and are just stacked up with errands and chores everyday, they lose sight of what is really important in their life. I wanted to give back to the people with a video that showed what is really precious in a short amount of time. They will experience heartfelt love for nature, animals, other people, basically life in general. I realized this, because I was unhappy with how my days were going, I felt as if I was missing something important. In one of the years of my life, I went through an ordeal, after that was settled I remembered how happy I was when I got rid of the materialistic ideals and wanted to express that to others who are unhappy as well.
