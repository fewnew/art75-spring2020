My family and I always enjoyed the green open area that the country side proveds. I personally will forever appreciate being able grow up in a environment where nature isn't seen as a pest, but a piece of art. I included most of the animels I seen throught my years living in such areas in Margan hill, San Martin and Gilroy. What was also included were sea creatures. 
One of my favorite hobbies are fishing on the cost of California. I consider it my second home. 
The animels have spotted lines across their bodys. These patterns show the alignments of the goldren ratio, which is implemented into natures natural laws.
