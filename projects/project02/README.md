# Project 02

For this project explore the concept of **Identity and the Meaning of Home** and use Adobe Aero as the main component to tell a highly creative narrative as it relates to the theme. Select projects will then be presented in April for an amazing art exhibition at Black Gallery. 
<br>
Create a story about this concept using your AR work --- What does it mean to you? <br>
The best place to start is with the STORY -->  the what. <br><br>
Varied stories can be imagined when asked about Identity and the Meaning of Home, so what does this personally mean to each of us? Might it be a home you desire, a home from a past memory, a home or identity from your imagination as it relates to the past, present or future? Is there a person, place or thing that emerges when you hear a song or story about the subject? What is there? Who is there? Your creation can be real, and it can be a feeling or an idea. Articulate your project idea by showing what you are thinking & how it should feel..
<br>
One part of your project is your AR component but the other portion will be how to present this work in real space and time. Additionally, share how your AR work will be presented (screen, projection, stage, iPad, or phone).  Will your final work require sound, special lighting, or any other details that would help transform your artwork in the exhibition space?
<br>
Proposals are due March 4th and should include:<br>
* A written project plan exploring your concept of Identity and the Meaning of Home, as seen in your work.
* Image samples of the space and the exhibition work you are building, along with all elements to be included
* A video sample of your Adobe Aero/AR work you want to present.
* If you choose to incorporate sound, special lighting or any another element - please include those in your proposal as well
