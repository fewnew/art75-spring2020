  For my project, I wanted to highlight different aspects of what home and identity is. Home is not the same for
  everyone, so a home could be a place, another person, or even activities. For me, I find home in a special place, 
  in my family, and in activities I really enjoy doing. For my project, I will have displays around the room that show these
  three different aspects of home and identity that I am claiming. It is meant to be viewed through one's phone and one would
  have to explore the room to find my aspects of home. The setup I have in my video sample is very simple and is just an idea 
  of what it could look like; I will definitely be adding onto what I have so far.
