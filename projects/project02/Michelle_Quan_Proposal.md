* Sofas. Chairs. TVs. Pictures. Laptops. Today, most living or family rooms consist of these items. Throughout time, while technology and design trends come and go, the purpose of a family room remains the same: to spend time together with family. Of all the rooms in a house, my memories of spending time with friends and family in this room differentiated a home from any other building. Over the years, the items in my parents’ living room have moved around and changed, but we all still spent time together through watching films, playing games, etc. either on a couch or the floor.

* In an exhibition space, I would have a loveseat couch and stock family pictures in frames as a centerpiece in the room with pieces of “old” technology around the couch or the family aspect. Using Aero, when a mobile device points at an old piece of technology in the room, a new version of the item would be seen on the device. For example, when the mobile device points at a joystick in the room, a Nintendo Switch would cover the joystick, conveying that while entertainment and group activities have changed, the idea of being together is still there. I would have Hence, everything in the room except the couch and the family pictures would be digitally manipulated in AR in order to convey my idea of home and family.
