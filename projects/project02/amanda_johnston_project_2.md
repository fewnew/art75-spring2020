**Description**


Land of the Almond Blossom is an abstracted look at where I call home, it is of course,
a distortion on the typical concept of home but one that is more relevant to me personally. 
The central valley where I grew up and now currently live has changed so much over the last 
twenty years and has turned into a valley of almond orchards, exponentially more almond 
orchards than when I was a child. The multiple layers of blossoms are a reference to that. 
I have travelled and lived in other areas and states, but whenever I think of home I think 
of almond orchards. The layer of clouds in the background is a reference to the free spirit 
part of my personality and also a reference to how displaced I currently feel not having a 
permanent home of my own, and how I paradoxically enjoy the freedom that comes with that displacement. 


**Presentation**


I will have the printed 2D metal panel 24x32 inches hanging on the wall, I am hoping to use 
the "anchor to image" option to get the aero file to recognize the 2D printed image in order 
to have the dimensions and placement connected to and coming out from the 2D work. I am also 
attempting to create a QR code I can have on the title card mounted next to the 2D artwork, 
and printed instructions on how to import the file and where and how to anchor it.
