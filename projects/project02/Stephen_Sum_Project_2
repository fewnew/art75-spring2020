5. My play of creating a "home" for myself would be in the sense of imagining life where I was an athletic professional. Growing up, I had always wanted to be a professional in some field of sport. Whether it be in the NBL or the National Gaming Leagues, I had always dreampt of one of them and making money off of a profession/hobby I enjoy doing. As I sit down at the top of the hill, I lay back onto the ground and I start imagining what my life would have been like if I were to have gone with my ideal profession. The camera points towards the thought bubbles that are coming out of my head. Inside the bubbles, there starts images of professional athletes overtime from different sports. After it finishes through all the athletes, it then pans back to me and I close my eyes to give gesture that I would have loved the life that I dream of. The screen then goes black as the music intensifies and the title ends the video.
