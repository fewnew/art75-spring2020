## Description
Growing up in a small suburban city, there is not really much to see and it is a totally different environment than a busy city like San Jose. Participating in my high school cross country team and track team for 4 years, I have spent a lot of time running on outside trials around my hometown. These trails did not just help me with my athletic skills but I have also formed relationships by running with other people. For my project, I wanted to focus on the aspect of trails because growing up in a suburban city there are numerous trails that surround my neighborhood and school. I originally planned on printing out maps for the physical portion of the project and have my animated character run on that, but instead, I decided to actually film on some of the actual trails and pathways I ran on. Instead of adding background music, I decided to keep the original sound of my videos because those are the raw sounds I hear when I am running around my hometown. This art piece can be experienced anywhere, but the best place to watch it is on a smartphone.
