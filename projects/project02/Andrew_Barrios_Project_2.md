For this project I wanted to consider a particular aspect of home that I do not think is often considered. That being the claustrophibic and cramped nature of growing up at home. Sharing a space with siblings you are always put in a space where you do not have enough room to grow or live comfortably. You are surrounded on all sides and confined in a box in which there is no escape. I wanted to explore this idea by trapping the user in a space where they aresurrounded by objects all the way up to the ceiling.
