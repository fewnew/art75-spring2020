5. Description 

The Galaxy Garden was created to venture the world in a different aspect. People look at nature and just see plants and life, but do they get creative and try to imagine what was there or could be there. The idea of the galaxy is to experience the technology that was created throughout time, a future theme. The garden is to give a little attention to the nature that is in front of everyone. The world is mixed with nature and technology everywhere, there is more to the world because we have not ventured out into the universe in person. So the possibilities that are out there could be there, just the imagination to get there is what starts people to do more. However, people should not look over what is in front of them first before going beyond then what they can see. The audience of this project is for everyone, to look at what is there but also imagine what could be there to move forward from where they are and do better.
