Home does not have to be a single place or location. To me, the meaning of home could be in a game, being an online character 
playing with your “family” online friends. Home could be on social media or just the fact that you can meet new friends and 
become life long friends. The place where it reaches all emotions, whether watching a horror movie to playing video games, 
I believe that the online platform is where I’m home. Comparing it to our physical home, which is an actual location; comparing 
the physical and cognitive. The story I’m trying to tell is that gaming and meeting online friends can be home; talking every day 
online but also having a feeling of a close connection.
