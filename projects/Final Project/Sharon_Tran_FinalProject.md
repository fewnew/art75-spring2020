5. Crossing on Foliage is my desire to create my utopian world. This world was inspired by the video game series, "Animal Crossing". I was captivated with their vibrant aspect that encompasses the bright and positive emotions. By creating a natural and rural space of what I called "Crossing on Foliage", I envision the preservation of the greenery by bringing out the beauty of flowers covered in frost in sunflower, aloe vera, and hibiscus flower. As well as displaying a gold metallic and glass-like sculptures to focus on environmental aesthetics.
  The front lotus flower sculptures symbolize the purity of the mind and the desire to overcome personal struggles. The back left side shows a brass human heart symbolizing the expression of emotion and spiritual being. The back right side is a sculpture of a full bloom flower with a gold metallic vase associating the healing energy to nature. The snow globe-like sculpture is for viewers to immerse themselves through nostalgic memories and self-reflection to the inner self. My purpose of this exhibition is not just about capturing the aesthetics of my utopian world but to encapsulate the synergistic energy of healing towards self-awareness. With reflective glass and bubbles invokes the transparency of self-reflection.
